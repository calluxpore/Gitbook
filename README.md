# Creation & Computation

In this course, I was introduced to the latest prototyping and development tools in digital technology, with a focus on hands-on, project-based learning. I gained foundational skills in programming, physical computing, visual computation, and networking. The course, tailored to current digital issues, prepared me for more complex creative digital media projects. Emphasizing learning through experimentation, it steered away from creating products and instead focused on developing speculative, future-oriented experiences. The course's framework involved four interactive projects that allowed me to blend my existing skills in art, design, media, and technology with new digital tools, fostering an idea-driven rather than technology-focused approach. In addition to lectures and readings, my learning involved contextual research and independent exploration to refine my project concepts, ultimately leading to the creation of comprehensive interactive designs.



Key Projects Completed:

* **Emotive Objects:** Employing programming and physical computing to transform a selected verb from Richard Serra's "Verb List" into an interactive, material object.
* **Multiscreen:** Leveraging advanced visual computation and networking for project development.
* **Connected Systems:** Creating an interactive design centered around a self-selected research question using emerging technologies.
* **Interstitial Spaces:** Developing a speculative, interactive project that synthesizes all the skills and concepts learned, prioritizing conceptual depth.
